# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
*This project is to help a playwright, Louise, to determine if the use of crowdfunding is a viable source for funding her play. She is estimating a budget of $10,000. 
*Louise was also interested in learning about the Great Britain theater market, looking specifically at musicals. Looking at a budget of $4,000 for a future project in this arena.

### Purpose
To analyze data from other crowdsourcing campaigns, looking specifically at plays to determine what factors contributed to the most successful outcomes so that Louise can mirror them in the hopes to be successful in her endeavor.

## Analysis and Challenges
*I compiled and sorted the data to meet current needs. I then modified format to make all data readable. 
*Data shows that of the 912 theater campaigns, 525 were successful. By drilling down further to specifically look at plays, we can see that of the 314 campaigns, 238 were successful reflecting over 75% success rate. 
*Failed campaigns had much higher fundraising goals as well as having mean and median pledge amounts that were much lower than the successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May is the best month to begin a campaign followed closely by June so late spring is definitely timeframe to target. Also noted the length of time the fundraising campaigns lasted, the most successful were fairly short in duration, lasting between a week and 2 months.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
*I compared failed kickstarter campaigns against sussessful kickstarter campaigns and noted the failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals. Louise is asking for $10,000, which is more than twice that of successful campaigns. I would suggest lowering the goal.
*There were some outliers that likely indicate fundraising for plays in conjunction with theater building proposals. These can be eliminated as Louise isn't looking to build a theater.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*Challenges encountered were not having accurate data outcomes, but not knowing where the error occurred. Turns out a refresh on a pivot table fixed my issues in the end. Office hours and time with Jacob going through the data, helped me find and fix the issue. 
*Other challenges were being so focused on following the steps and getting the correct outcome, I wasn't paying attention to the bigger picture and drawing necessary conclusions as I went. To overcome this, I went back and extracted out information and complied it in OneNote for myself to review later and also to see how the pieces fit together into the bigger picture. I plan to do this for future modules proactively.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May is the most successful month to launch a campaign, followed closely by June. 
2. In all months of the year, there were more successful campaigns than failed campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There is over 70 percent success rate for campaigns with a goal of $5,000 or less and a 55% success rate for those asking between $5,000 and $10,000. 
There were no canceled campaigns in the dataset looking at Outcomes based on Goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We filtered lots of data to look specifically at plays, there could be additional data gleaned from looking at other kickstarter campaigns based on country or time of year or funding goals as well as who donates highest amounts overall. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could look at the average donation for the successful versus failed campaigns and the correlation to the goal. 
*We could look at the average donation for the successful versus failed campaigns and the correlation to the goal.
*We could look at all plays, not just in the U.S.
